    "A prevalent complex clinical combination of symptoms and signs known as heart failure is brought on by a decrease in the heart's function as a pump supporting the circulatory system (National Guideline Centre, 2018). The death risk in the first year after treatment is about 35% while the risk of death is less than 10% in the second year for those that are still alive (National Clinical Guideline Centre, 2010). Data analysis on heart failure is significant because it can provide valuable insights into the causes and  risk factors of heart failure. We will look into different patients‚Äô health reports and their experience of heart failure to help us determine the factors that are most influential in predicting possible death of patients with heart failure. \n"

According to a study conducted by Ahmad et al.
